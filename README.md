=============

Third-party tracking protection tool for content
sites.  Measure tracking protection by your audience,
and encourage readers to get protected.

When fewer readers can be tracked from site to site,
it's harder for ad money to flow to fraud and misinfo
sites.

How to set up: [Aloodo for Web Publishers](https://www.aloodo.org/publishers/)

Test it at: [tracking protection test](http://www.aloodo.org/test/)


How it works
------------

The `ad.aloodo.com` site is a fake "tracker" designed to be detected and blocked by web privacy tools.

Any tracking protection method will work.

 * Third-party JavaScript blocking

 * Third-party cookie blocking

 * Cookie double-keying

 * Blocklists (Aloodo appears on the commonly used ones)

This is intended to get non-users of tracking protection tools started with something, not to advocate for
a particular approach or tool.


FAQ
---

**Should I add ad.aloodo.com to my tracking protection tool's blacklist?** Yes, please.

**Can I add just the iframe to my site?** Yes, please.

**What should I install to protect myself from third-party tracking?**  Get good [tracking protection](http://www.aloodo.org/protection/), not just
a general-purpose ad blocker.

**Why does it need to track across three sites, not just two?** The [Privacy Badger](https://www.eff.org/privacybadger) extension needs to see tracking on three sites in order to start blocking.  If Aloodo alerted to blocking at two, it would be confusing for Privacy Badger users.
