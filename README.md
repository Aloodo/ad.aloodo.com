How to set up: [Aloodo for Web Publishers](https://www.aloodo.org/publishers/)

Test it at: [tracking protection test](http://www.aloodo.org/test/)


How to pass the Aloodo test
---------------------------

The fake "tracking" is designed to be obvious and foiled by any decent tracking protection tool.  

 * Third-party JavaScript blocking

 * Third-party cookie blocking

 * Cookie double-keying

 * Explicit blacklisting

This is intended to get non-users of tracking protection tools started with something, to help shift the benefits of web advertising toward sites and brands, and away from intermediaries and fraud.


FAQ
---

**Should I add ad.aloodo.com to my tracking protection tool's blacklist?** Yes, please.

**Can I add just the iframe to my site?** Yes, please.

**Can I fork this, send pull requests, all that stuff?** Yes, please.

**What should I install to protect myself from third-party tracking?**  Get good [tracking protection](http://www.aloodo.org/protection/), not just
a general-purpose ad blocker.

**Why does it need to track across three sites, not just two?** The [Privacy Badger](https://www.eff.org/privacybadger) extension needs to see tracking on three sites in order to start blocking.  If Aloodo alerted to blocking at two, it would be confusing for Privacy Badger users.
